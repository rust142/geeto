## v0.3.8 — February 20, 2026

### Breaking Changes

- Package renamed to "geeto"; update your install commands and any scripts that referenced the old package name.
- Homebrew formula updates were moved to a separate tap repository, so Homebrew formula changes are no longer updated in this repo.

### New Features

- Generate release notes automatically using AI providers.
- Add an inline terminal editor for editing files and commit messages inside the CLI.
- Add boxed UI, file status badges, and step progress indicators for a clearer interface.
- Add interactive workflows: undo last action, commit amend, stash manager, commit history viewer, PR & Issue workflows, cherry-pick, branch compare, and branch cleanup.
- Add a release/tag manager and a --tag CLI flag for releasing.
- Add a repository statistics dashboard accessible via --stats.
- Add Trello integration: menu, checklist support, multi-select card selection, and export of task instructions.
- Add searchable and multi-select menus, range selection, clickable branch links, and short flag aliases for faster navigation.
- Add an uninstall script and improved installer.

### Improvements

- Show push progress and remote URL, and improve push progress granularity and handling.
- Add build and publish binaries workflow, packaging, and a generated VERSION constant for releases.
- Add Homebrew formula generation via CI environment variables.
- Improve UX and menu rendering, including better multiSelect rendering and commit selection in security gate.
- Add custom protected branches and sort branches by age/staleness.
- Offer to stage changes automatically and add a --stage-all option.
- Improve AI-related flows: Copilot install flow, provider/model prompts, provider state persistence, English translation, and safety instructions.

### Bug Fixes

- Suppress noisy Node.js experimental warnings coming from the Copilot subprocess.
- Improve git push/error handling and make fatal errors exit cleanly.
- Fix spinner and progress bar output so logs and progress do not interleave.
- Treat newly created branches as safe for checkout and improve branch cleanup messages.
- Fix various workflow logging issues (avoid 'Unknown' step, remove hard-coded version in banner, preserve provider state after cleanup).
- Ensure git commands run with correct flags so push/branch logs behave properly.

### Documentation & Packaging

- Clean up RELEASE.MD history and remove outdated Homebrew/workflow notes.
- Overhaul README and CONTRIBUTING, add a Demo section with images and an asciinema demo, and add install.sh.
- Update package metadata and normalize the executable path; update install instructions to match the package rename.
- Move Homebrew formula handling to the tap repo and update CI to generate formulas as needed.
